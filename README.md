[02:43.10] Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat
[02:46.07] I need cash so when I'm cool I am never ever weak
[02:48.35] Places are fluid and diluted and complete
[02:50.74] Check me once, calm down and take a seat
[02:52.71] Strip the chains the freedom's there but then it is gone

[03:18.86] 
[03:12.49] Defiance ripping up the south set
[03:14.24] Every time I am gripping the mic it is a sound threat
[03:16.69] Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in
[03:19.82] Timmy see
